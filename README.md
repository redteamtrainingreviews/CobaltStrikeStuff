# Cobalt Strike Stuff
Various Script(s) I have written for use with Cobalt Strike


### safe_mode.cna

I was working on creating aliases to block certain commands within Cobalt Strike, and I was asked if I knew how to create a toggle option where they could be run, or blocked, depending on the toggle setting.  This is my attempt at creating that script.
