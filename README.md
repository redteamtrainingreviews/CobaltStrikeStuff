# Cobalt Strike Stuff
Various Script(s) I have written for use with Cobalt Strike


### safe_mode.cna

I was working on creating aliases to block certain commands within Cobalt Strike, and I was asked if I knew how to create a toggle option where they could be run, or blocked, depending on the toggle setting.  This is my attempt at creating that script.

### ip_checker.cna

I needed a way to check if an IP address had been entered as an argument and I eventually found a script somewhere on the Internet and I based this code off of that script.  I don't recall who wrote the original, or how much I actually changed it to become this script, but this is what I ended up with. If I find what I based this off of, I will post credits.
